INTBODUOTION. xxiii

ingenio suo imperare quom indulgere maluisset. His
work during his exile, usfar as we know, consisted
of a revision and perhaps eompletion of the Fasti, and
the compositiones the Elegies known aa the Tristia
in five books, and the Pontiae Epistles in four⁴¹.

The Heroides, or Epistulae Heroidurt are ima-
ginary letters from women oi the heroic or legendary
egeto various heroes. They have all this common
feature, that they are written in sorrow for the loss ol'
his society to whom they are addressed But their
circumstances otherwise differ widely. Penelope, Her-
mione and Laodamia have suffered no wrong from the
man whom they address; while Phaedra is a vistim of
inssistible passion, and Medea, besides the wrong
done her by Jason, has upon her all the horrors of
remorsa ior crimes she has herself committed.
Briseis, on the other hand, has only violence to eom-
plain of from another, aad supineness on the part ol'
her lover. Ariadne, (linoae, Deianira, Hypsipyle,
Dido have all got a clear ease, and are able te utter
direct and well deserved reproeohes to their betrayers.

These Epistles have been perhaps the mostpopular
of all Ovid’s works. They were hnown and read
throughout the middle eges. Immediately after the
invention of printing editions of them appeared in
quiok suceession 3 and they have maintained an almost
undimiuished popularity up to the present day. The
reason ie not sar to seelr. They are highly dramatis.
Eaeh heroine has distinet and striking characteristios3
and yet the theme of them all, unhappy love, issimple
and one which hes ever, and probably will ever, oom-
mand interest and awaken feeling.

⁴² The latter he says were not meant to ¹form a book, but
consisted of separate letters to his various friends, afterwards
oolleoled without regard to their proper order. Pone. 3, 9, 51
