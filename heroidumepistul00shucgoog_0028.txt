The distinction is a wide one. Unbridled coarse-
ness of invective, descriptione the most nauseous, jests
the most filthy, might be passed over, or allowed some ,

there in spite of his sbject lettera Hoeven ut last carne
to feel some affcctim for the place, in return for kindness and
honour shown to him:

Quom grata tetigitur Latonae Delio tellau
Erroata' tatum quoe dedit aaa locam
Tam mihi cara Tomis: patrio quac sede fugatis
