Tne story 01 Protesilaus ie briefly thie. ¹'lbere wae an ’

touched Trojan soil should immediately be killed Protesilaus
01 Phylace, in Thessaly, led the warriors 01 several Thesealian
towns, and in spite 01 thie oracla was the first 10 leap on the

[We have no materiale in our hande which Ovid could have
used except the passage in Homer, Il. 2, eae-7022

ζωὸς ἐόν· τότε δ’ ἤδη ἔχεν κάτα ’γαΐα μέλαινα.
ποῦ δὲ καὶ ἀμφιδρυφὴς ἄλοχος Φυλάκῃ ἐλέλειπτο
καὶ δόμος ἠμπελής· τὸν δ’ ἔκτανε Δάρδανος ἀνὴρ
νηὸς ἀποθρώσκοντα πολὺ πρώτιστον Ἀχαιῶν.

But we can gather from the poem that Ovid hae used 1411004
traditione which euit his purpose. For instance he lmowe the
story 01 her being found by her husband, when allowed 10
return 10 earth, embracing hie image, eee 151 eq. The tale
however hasbeen often told, and with many variatione, by later
writers ; among othere by Lucian, ‘Dialogues of the Dead'
23. And it ie made more interesting to ue byhaving formed the
subject ο1 one 01 the fineet poeme 01 our own Wordeworth.
