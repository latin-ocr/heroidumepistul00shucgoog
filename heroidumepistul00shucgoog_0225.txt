186 Nonus XII. “

Euripides, some feeling iorhledea is excited by the prominenee
given to J ason’s wrong: while the violent and ghastly nature oi
her revenge is kept in the back ground: the uorat ciali, the
murder oi her children, being only darkly hinted in the leet
line, Nescio quid certe 00000 creo majus ugit.

[The story of Medea no doubt Ovio knew so well 00 scarcely
to be consciens oi using any one authority. The most detailed
accounts oi the table we have, which were likely to be in Ovid's
hands, ere that of Apollodorus, lib. l, and that oi Apollonius,
lib. 3. Ovid no doubt also was well acquainted with the
Medea of Euripides. And we are able egain to notice how'
Seneca has followed in Ovid’s steps, in his tragedy ol Medea.

weight (peneum) 01 wool which the Fetes ure to spin, end when

7-10. Ovid is no doubt thinking oi the opening lines in
the Medea of Euripides:
εἴθ’ ὤφελ’ Ἄργους μὴ διαπταῖσθαι σκάφος
Κόλχων ἐς αἶαν κυανέας Συμπληγάδας
μηδ’ ἐν νάπαισι Πηλίου πεσεῖν πότε
τμηθεῖσα πεύκη, μηδ’ ἐρετμῶσαι χέρας
ἀνδρῶν ἀριστέων.

Phrixeam: the fleeee citharam that carneti Phrixus.
