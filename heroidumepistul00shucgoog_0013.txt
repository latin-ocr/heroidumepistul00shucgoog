how likely mere referenoes are to be passed over. Re·
ferenoes however to other parts of the Epistles aro
generally given with the number of Epistle and line

only. These vvho will not take the trouble to turn to
another part of a book in their hands are not likely
to use notes of any sort with much interest or profit
As to grammatioal information I have deoided to refer
to one Grammar only, that of Mr Roby. No doubt
references might have been profitably given to Madvig
and others. But nearly averything is to be found in
Roby’s work; and it is perhaps more in the hands
of English Students than any other, as it vvell de

serves to he; taking rank as it does with Mr Munro’s
Lucretius, and Professor Mayor’s J uvenal,-the three

great works vvhioh have in our day done most to

vindicate the honour of Iatin Scholarship in England
I have also referred my readers from time to time to
Ramsay’s Roman Antiquitas, and to Rioh's Diolioaary
of Roman aad Greek neruosae.

It only remains for me to express my thanks
to the Provost of Eton for his kindness in putting
the Eton Mss. into my hands: and to my friend

and colleague the Rev. F. St. J. Thaokeray for kindly
reading over the proofs of some sheets of the notes,

and aiding me with valuable suggestions and correo·
tions.
