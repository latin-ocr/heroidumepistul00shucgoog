The conclusion arrived at from these various hints
of the Pectat any rate must be that there was
another cause of a personal nature affecting Augustus,
which brought about the disaster besides the immo·
rality of his poema. The ostensible cause however
put forward in the Edict was this 3 nor can we say
that it was not a plausible or matrefacic a sufficient
cause, in spite of the fact that they had been published
ten years. N o doubt rnuch that was coarse and licen·
tious hed been written before and had found at any
rate toleration„end much was being daily written of .
the same nature. But nothing had been written before,
nor I think has been written since, which so de·
liberetely and with such apparent seriousness sys-
temizes vice and ignores all idea of virtue. It is
surprising to hear pleaded thet Horace was es licen-

tious, or that Augustus wrote uncleanly epigrama
