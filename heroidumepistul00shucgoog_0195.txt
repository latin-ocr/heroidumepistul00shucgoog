Hermone onustam.

Hermoun, daughter ol Menelaus aud Helen, growing up
during the abseuoe ot her father et the Trojan war aud her
mother’s flight with Paris, was betrothed by her grandfather
Tyndareus to Orestes son oi Agamemnon. But her father had

. meanwhile promised her to Pyrrhus, son ot Achilles, and upon

’ his return bestowed her on him, rejeoting Orestes on aooount ol ι
’ his pollution by the murder ot lus mother (Eur. Andr. 977-
981). In Eun idee' Andromache we find Hermione living
unhappily with hus, with iustoeuseIeriealousy ou aooount
ethis oonneotion with Andromaohe This hint iseno
ior Ouid, as iu the ease oi Briseis. He imagines her from e
firstte have been attaehed to Orestes and to be writing this
letter expressing her misen, reproaohing him ior not eoming to
resoue her and eloim his afflaneed bride, and deelaring her de-
termination to be faithful to him.

[Whether the legend had appeared definitely in the ehspe in
whieh Ovid indicates it is not of much importunae. For he
treats the story quite generally, and makes Hermione speah
ae any woman detained by one she detested hom one she loved
might be supposed to speah And there is no euoh appearanoe
of a oonsoious following of euy model ee in the ease ol most ol
the previous Epistles]
