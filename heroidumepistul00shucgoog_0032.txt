INTRODUOTION. . xxv

(2) The Godex Guelferbytanus ( G) Gof the 12111
century, corrected and annotated 1n the 13th.

The readings 11 these two MSS. are given from

Merkel's collation at the end of this introduction.

' (3) But besides these two MSS. another 11 great
antiquity has been long known to exist in the Eton
Collega Library (Codex longobardicus), whither it
was probably brought by Sir Henry Wotton from
Venice. Its readings have been from time to time .
examined, but it has never before been thoroughly
collated. I have thought it worth while therefore to
give a complete collation 11 it in the critical notes (Ε).
It is pronounced to he 11 the llth century 3 and it
unfortunately presente many 11 the characteristic
readings 11 the MSS. 11 the recension mentioned
above, as having taken place some time in that
century. It is in Gothic characters, and only con-
tains 11 the Epistles from the beginning to 7, 157,-
breaking 'off abruptly in the middle 11 1 couplet

Ἴ It contains besides this fragment of the Epistles (1)

’1111111111 carmina, (2) Gornelius Gallus, (3) Statii

Achilleis, (4) Ovidii Remedia amoris, and following

the Epistles (5) Aratoris Carmina⁴⁴.

(4) I have also given the readings 11 another Etcn
MS. (ε). This rs a beautiful French MS. 11 the
end 11 the 13th or beginning 11 the llth century.
It contains all the usually received works oi Ovid,
except the Consolatio ad Liviam, and besides them
some ehorter spurious pieces da Sompnio, da Paliae,
da 011111, de mirabilibus Mundi. Ihave given its
readings, not as being 11 any special velue, but

because they serve as a fair specimen 11 the readings
11 the MSS. 11 thie later age.

⁴⁴ rme ΜΒ. has boen collated lor H. S. Sedlmayer, and
described by him in his Prolegomena Gritica, Vienna 1878. I
think however in one instance at least he has been wrongly
„intormed as to its reading.
