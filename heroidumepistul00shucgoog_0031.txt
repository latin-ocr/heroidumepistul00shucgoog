xxiv 01711111 EPISTULAE.

, There are twenty one of these Epistles which haye
been attributed to Ovid. But 01 these, the last seven
have been now pretty generally pronounced to be by
another hand. Αο6 without entering further ιιι10 the
question we may without difficulty acknowledge their
inferiority m many ways. ΙιιΙ this edition Ι have
undertaken to deal with the first fourteen only, and
of them have omitted the eleventh: notas being
iuferior,—for it seems tc me tc possess an energy and
passion superior 10 most of the others-but because its
subject is such as tc make its absence at any rate no
matter of regret in a book intended primarily for
Schools.

As 1ο the title of the book there is much vari-
ation in the MSS.; and the fact perhaps is that it
was commonly spoken of either as ‘Epistulae’ or
‘Heroides', but that the full title was ‘Heroidum
Epistulae’3 which indeed expresses the actual nature
of the book, if the last seven letters, some of which are
from the H eroes to the Heroines, are not genuine⁴¹.

almost superstitious veneration Ι1 doubtless is the
highest authority we have, though not without many
mistakes. Its great value consists in the fact that it
was written betore the recension of the text which
took place some time in the llth century, and which
has affected all the other Mss. which wo p'ossess‘⁸.
