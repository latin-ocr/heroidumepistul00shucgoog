Epistle must be supposed to bs written inst at the end of ths ten
years’ wandering, and on the eve of Ulysses’ return, if V. 99,

[The materiale ior this Epistle arev to be found in the
Odyssey: but Ovid uses them freely and without earing munh
for consistenoy. For instanoa, Telemachus who at the opening
of the Odyssey has evidently arrived at man's estate, holding
his own against the suitors‚ and tatdng part in ths agona, is
spoken of as a puer v. 98. Andin v. NPenslope speaks ofhim ¹
as sent in quest of his father, whereas he is said in the Odyssey
to have gone without her knowledge]
