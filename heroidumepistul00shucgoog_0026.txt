literary history. ΜΓ Munro (Calai. p. 185) sayst
‘Dates and his own reiterated hints prove beyond any
reasonable doubt that Ovid's disaster was connected
with the detection of the younger J ulia' This dulia
was the grand-daughter of Augustus and- vas banishsd
, iu the same year as Ovid. The circumstances which
led to her punishment vere such as to make it quite
possible that Ovid‚ or any one else leading a life of
free pleesure in the higher society of Rome, should
have been implicated more or less remotely iu her
crimes. But granting this, it is still an unsolved
mystery in what way Ovid was involved, and what
bis particular offense to Augustus Arvas. In the
Classical Museum (vol 4, p. 229, of 1847) ΜΓ Dyer
has laboured to show that his crime was that of
having been privy to Julia’s adultery with Decius
Julius Silanus, and having concealed it.

His own language in speaking of the causes of his
banishment seems to go through tvo pheses. He
first seems to wish to convey the idea that his youth-
ful indiscretion in publishing his Amatory treatises
was the sole cause. ‘He is a poet destroyed by his
own genius3 his verses have been his uudoing ; they
deserved punishment but surely not so heavy a 0ue⁸⁴.’
But presently he begins to own that there was another
cause3 not, he is carelul to state, any politioal offence3
no plot against the Emperor 3 no plan of violence
against the statc³⁶. He had seen something that he
should not have seen. He is ruined by his simplieity
and want of prudeuoe, combined with treachery ou
